# What is an Algorithm ?
An Algorithm is a well-defined structure to solve a particular problem.

# How we will Measure Algorithm Complexity ?
We will make use of Asymptotic Notations (Big-O Notation).

# What are Asymptotic Notations ?
Are Mathematic tools used to Measure Complexity (Time, Space).

# Three Types of Asymptotic Notations :
    1. Big-O Notation - Worst Case Complexity.
    2. Omega Notation - Best Case Complexity.
    3. Theta Notation - Average Case Complexity.
